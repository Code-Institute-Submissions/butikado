# Entity-Relationship Diagram

- ** ERD stands for Entity-Relationship Diagram. It's a visual representation used in database modeling to illustrate the relationships between different entities within a database. An ERD helps in designing a database at the conceptual, physical, and logical levels by showing the entities (or tables), their attributes, and the connections (relationships) between them, facilitating a clearer understanding of the database's structure and flow.
